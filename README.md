# Bio_Inspired_Learning

## About this project
Individual project of Matteo Lusvarghi (5470641) for Bio-Inspired Learning Course. 
  The hereby project is an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm and its application to the Lunar Lander environment
from the box2d folder of the OpenAI gym library. 
  The implications and the results obtained from this simulation will be analyzed in the correspondent report. 

## Prerequisites
A list of the necessary things to do before running the script:
- install the *pytorch* library 
- use the following line of code to install the box2d environments in order to access the Lunar Lander one
  ```
  pip install gym[box2d]
  ```
## Explanation
The main file to run to obtain the results is *reinforce.py*. *utils.py* and *parallel_env.py* are support files from ehich
